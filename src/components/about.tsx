        <p className="mb-4">I'm a passionate software developer with a knack for bringing ideas to life in the digital world. My coding journey started back in 2012 when I took on the challenge of creating a basic calculator using Pascal instructions during high school. That was just the beginning!</p>
        <p className="mb-4">I went on to earn my B.S. in Software Engineering, and ever since, my path as a software developer has been an exhilarating ride filled with exciting challenges and deeply rewarding experiences.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Beyond coding, I'm all about exploring new places, meeting fascinating people, and immersing myself in different cultures. When I'm not diving into lines of code or jet-setting to new destinations, you'll likely find me out for a run or on the football field. These activities keep me grounded and ready for the next coding adventure.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">Thanks for stopping by my digital corner. Let's connect and team up to create something truly amazing! ðŸ˜ŠðŸš€</p>
