            I enjoy building web applications. My interest about coding started back in 2012, I created a very simple calculator using <Link className="font-medium link" href={'https://www.freepascal.org/'}>Pascal</Link> instructions. 
            Right after, I completed my B.S. in Software Engineering, since then my journey as a software developer has been filled with exciting challenges and rewarding experiences.
